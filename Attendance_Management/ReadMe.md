As we know there are many issues like buddy punching problems, human errors while entering the data manually and waste of time & money occurs in traditional attendance marking. Also while marking attendance on a sheet that could be a distraction for the students in the lecture time.
We developed a fingerprint attendance management system for overcoming all the problems occurring in the traditional attendance marking. We can avoid the buddy punching by taking the attendance by a fingerprint scanner as everyone has unique fingerprint pattern. Also this will reduce the cost of the paper consumption in a long run. Since we scan their fingerprint at the beginning and end of the lecture time we can ensure that the student attended the class and there won’t be interactions in the lecture time. And the human work of the administration would be reduced a lot as they don’t have to input data manually.
